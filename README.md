Password Strength Validation Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a password strength validation tool that assesses the strength of user passwords based on predetermined criteria. The tool will help users create strong and secure passwords to enhance their online security.

Features
Password Complexity Assessment: The tool will analyze the complexity of a password by considering factors such as length, character diversity, and inclusion of special characters, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.

Strength Evaluation: Using a scoring system, the tool will assign a strength rating to each password. This rating will indicate the level of security provided by the password, ranging from weak to strong.

Real-time Feedback: Users will receive immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords, along with specific suggestions for improvement. The tool will guide users towards creating stronger passwords by highlighting areas of weakness.

Password Requirements: The tool will enforce specific password requirements, such as minimum length, inclusion of special characters, and avoidance of commonly used or easily guessable passwords. This will ensure that users create passwords that meet a certain level of security.
Usage
Input: Users will input their desired password into the tool's interface or pass it as an argument to the validation function.

Output: The tool will provide a strength rating for the password, along with suggestions for improvement if applicable. Users will be informed whether their password meets the required criteria.
